                <h2>KeePassXC is An Amazing Community Driven Open Source Password Manager [Not Cloud Based]</h2>

                <p>KeePassXC is a community fork of KeePassX which aims to be a cross-platform port for KeePass Password Safe (available for Windows). It is completely free to use and cross-platform as well (Windows, Linux, and macOS)</p>

                <p>In fact, it is one of the best password managers for Linux out there. It features options for both newbies and power users who want advanced controls to secure their password database on their system. </p>

                <p>Yes, unlike my favorite Bitwarden password manager, KeePassXC is not cloud-based and the passwords never leave the system. Some users do prefer to not save their passwords and secrets in cloud servers. </p>

                <p>Debian-based MX Linux is already an impressive Linux distribution with Xfce desktop environment as the default. Even though it works good and is suitable to run with minimal hardware configuration, it still isn’t the best Linux distribution in terms of eye candy.</p>

                <p>That’s where KDE comes to the rescue. Of late, KDE Plasma has reduced a lot of weight and it uses fewer system resources without compromising on the modern looks. No wonder KDE Plasma is one of the best desktop environments out there.</p>

                <h2>Shutdown Taking Too Long? Here’s How to Investigate and Fix Long Shutdown Time in Linux</h2>

                <p>This could cause a delay to the shutdown process as your system will wait for the running processes to stop for a predefined time period. After this time period, it sends the kill signal to force stop all the remaining running processes and shuts down the system.</p>
